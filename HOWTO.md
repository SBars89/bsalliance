# How to use this bot

## Basic concepts
- Bot can track immunes, including conqueror
- To track conqueror immunes correctly, you should forward "Server statistic" message once per day
- To see all known immunes, use `/immunes` command
- To delete immune from list, use `/delete Name` command
- Only authorized list of users have access to bot, so do not worry about privacy
- All forwards contain date and time of original message, so no need to forward immediately after battle
- Immunes older than 6 hours will be cleaned up automatically, eventually

## Farming

- After each attack, forward results to bot
- Press "No" button to not track immune of some random farm
- In 10 minutes it will remind you to attack again

## Cooldown tracking

- After solo or alliance attack, forward results of battle to bot
- Press "Yes" button to track immunes of enemies
- When immune ends, bot will notify you personally and in chat
